This package provides a lightweight, encrypted JSON-based database with support for collections, document operations, and aggregation. It uses the cryptography library for encryption and decryption of data, ensuring secure storage of your sensitive information. The PyPI package includes docstrings for each function to make it easier to learn.


### Use pip to download the latest release
```sh
pip install pyjondb
```
### Creating a database
```python
# Initialize the database
# The database function has optional values: 
# pyjondb.database("database", "mypassword", debug=True/False, absolute=True/False)
db = pyjondb.database("database", "mypassword")

# Create the database
# Note: you should only create the database if it doesnt already exist
db.create()
```
### Writing data to the database
```python
data = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "email": "john@example.com"
}
db.write(data)
```

### Read the data
```python
data = db.read()
print(data)
```

### PyJONDB Gets way more advanced than writing simple data. To learn more about collections, documents, aggregation, linking, and tree structures read the [docs](https://github.com/t-a-g-o/PyJONDB)


# Database Viewing Tool
In the `database-viewer` folder there is an executable which you can run along with any PyJONDB database file (.ndb extension)

#### Note: you cannot directly edit the database with the viewing tool
